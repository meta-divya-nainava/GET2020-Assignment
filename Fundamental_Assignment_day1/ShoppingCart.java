/*Assignment GET2020 day 1
 * Creating a Shopping Cart Class Using Object-Oriented Programming in JAVA

At the bare minimum, the shopping card should contain:

1. The cart must store the items that have been put in the cart. Each item of the cart must have some price.
2. The items should be updatable (e.g., to change the quantity of an item in the cart, add/remove items from the cart etc).
3. The items need to be fetchable as well—for example, to display the cart’s contents. 
4. The cart should be kept rather generic to make it more universally usable.
5. The ability to generate the bill of the cart items.*/

// Main class
package Fundamental_Assignment_day1;
import Fundamental_Assignment_day1.Menu;
import Fundamental_Assignment_day1.Admin;

public class ShoppingCart {
	public static void main (String args[])
	{ 
		Menu menu_object=new Menu();//Menu class contains welcome dashboard and action
		//Admin admin_object=new Admin(); //for admin purpose 
	}

}
